      <p>
        Hello, I am DarthTaksil. My friends call me Darth.
        <br><br>
        I have been watching Clint since 2017. I found him during my senior year of highschool. We were in the process of moving for the first time in my life. 
        In a new house, a new enviroment, everything felt different now. This was a place that I didn't spend 17 years of my life growing up in. It was a strange feeling. 
        Clint gave me a grounding point to go back to.
        <br><br>
        He was the second introduction I had into Speedrunning as a concept. My first was Summer Games Done Quick, when I watched Cosmo play through Ocarina of Time. I really like OoT if you can't tell.
        My brain broke a little seeing a game that I held in such a high regard be played in ways I never though possible.
        <br><br>
        I had to see more, but the only time I could watch was after midnight.
        There was one option with a few hundred viewers. It was Clint Stevens, and he never made it past Chickens that night.
        <br>
        And that's exactly why I went back to his stream every night.
        <br>
        Will he get past chickens? Will Dampe kill the run? Will he forget how to hess for no reason?
        <br>
        It was great.
        <br><br>
        But that's gone now.
        <hr>
        <h3>"Once on the Internet, always on the Internet."</h3>
        Is a quote I heard constantly growing up in the cyberspace. I wish it were true.
        <br><br>
        So many of the memories I have laying in bed after a rough week, watching Mr.Stevens play Ocarina of Time. 
        The guy that sacrificed 17 McChickens for good Dampe RNG. The tens of thousands of times doing chickens. Juno signaling the 'PB Alarm.'
        The snapchats during the intro cutscene. That guy that was at a new years eve party sitting in a corner of the room watching Clint instead of partying. 
        <br><br>
        Those moments are over, lost into the abyss, never to be seen or heard again, but not forgotten.
        
        <hr>
        <h3>My Goals With This Project</h3>
        Make a website that lets the user click a button and live through a random chunk of Clint Stevens history.
        <br><br>
        A byproduct of this goal is I'll archive what is left of those broadcasts.
        <br><br>
        As of writing this, the project is at 975 uploads. This is projected to be a 'half year long labor of love.' Uploading 100 more clips every night and appending the various lists of videos.
        <br><br>
        This project will forever be Free to Use. And I will do everything in my power to keep it ad-free.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for taking the time to read this. May one day we be graced with another "STEEEVE CLINTS DOES IT AGAIN" moment.
